# Session handoff

Live state shared between the agents working in this repository (OpenAI Codex,
primary; Claude, secondary) and the maintainer. Every agent session that
changes files or reaches a decision must update this file before ending. The
sections above the session log describe current state only; history belongs in
the log.

## How to resume

1. Read "Current state" and "Resume point" below.
2. Verify the claimed state cheaply (`git status`, `npm run check`) before
   building on it.
3. Do the work, update this file, and append a session-log entry.

## Current state — verified 2026-08-30

- Milestone 1 (single-image vertical slice) is complete. The maintainer accepted
  Sol + `high` + prompt-v2 artist/title quality for the early build; the formal
  private AI eval baseline is deferred until public rollout or model/cost
  optimization (`docs/ROADMAP.md`).
- Milestone 2's first slice is complete: front/back/spine/label/barcode/runout
  photos of one physical record can be grouped into a single scan and sent to
  the identifier as one request, each image paired with its view label
  (`album-identification.v3`). The single-image flow, audit trail, and
  existing scan/upload contracts are preserved — `viewType` defaults to
  `front` when omitted.
- `npm run check` passes in WSL on Node 22.23.2: formatting, ESLint, typecheck,
  and 39/39 unit tests.
- `npm run build` passes: the Next.js web app (16 routes), worker, and eval
  package compile cleanly.
- `npm run test:integration` passes in WSL/Docker: database (6), storage (1),
  queue (1), and worker (5, including the new multi-view worker test) suites,
  13/13 total. Migration `007_image_view_type.sql` applied cleanly to the
  running Postgres container.
- `npm run test:e2e` passes in WSL: 4/4 Playwright tests, including a new
  front/back/spine grouping scenario, against a production build with the
  synthetic worker. Chromium and its OS shared libraries
  (`sudo npx playwright install-deps`) are now installed on this machine's WSL.
- Docker Compose services (postgres, redis, minio) are running and healthy.
- This session's changes are uncommitted on `main`; `main` remains two commits
  ahead of `origin/main` from the prior session (nothing pushed).
- The maintainer's private dataset folder contains 52 JPEG cover photos plus a
  draft `manifest.json` and `LABELING_PROMPT.md`. These files remain outside
  the repository and still need app-assisted labels and maintainer verification.
- `packages/evals` provides a private, checkpointed Sol/Terra/Luna comparison
  runner with verified-label/consent gates, per-attempt audit output, aggregate
  quality/routing/latency/token/cost metrics, and non-billable unit coverage.
  Its single-image request path now passes the case's `viewType` through to
  the identifier so it stays contract-compatible with the multi-view change.
- Production album identification defaults to `gpt-5.6-sol` + `high` image
  detail. The ignored local `.env` is synchronized to the Sol default.

## Resume point

<!-- The next session starts here. Replace this section when the task
     completes or is re-scoped. -->

**Task:** the second Milestone 2 slice: multi-select batch setup — group
several distinct records (not just views of one record) into one batch with
independent per-item progress, cancellation, and retry. The current `/scan`
UI groups multiple photos into views of a _single_ record only; batching
across records is new UI, and likely a new `batch` grouping concept above
`scan` (see `docs/API.md`: "Batch creation returns independent scan IDs;
batch progress is a projection of those scans"). After that: thumbnail/
normalization pipeline, worker concurrency limits, and batch/cost dashboards.
The private AI matrix remains deferred until public rollout or model/cost
optimization.

Recently completed, for context:

- Multi-view grouping: `packages/contracts` gained `ImageViewTypeSchema`
  (`front`/`back`/`spine`/`label`/`barcode`/`runout`/`other`); `image_assets`
  gained a `view_type` column (migration 007); `GetScanResponse` now returns
  each scan's `images` array with per-image `viewType`; the OpenAI adapter
  sends every image with an `input_text` view label ahead of it
  (`buildAlbumIdentificationContent` in `packages/ai`); prompt v3 tells the
  model to combine complementary evidence across labeled views of the same
  physical record. The `/scan` page UI now shows a view grid with a per-photo
  "Photo type" selector instead of a single upload slot.
- Upload MIME sniffing fix (client declares content-derived type; HEIC gets a
  pre-upload hint), verified end-to-end.
- Phone-sized Playwright e2e suite (`npm run test:e2e`): production build on
  port 3100 from `.next-e2e`, dedicated `vinylhound_e2e` database and queue,
  synthetic worker in `apps/worker/src/e2e-worker.ts` (no OpenAI calls).

## Known gaps and risks

- No AI eval baseline; broad model/prompt optimization is not yet measurable.
- A historical live check on one byte-identical 4000x3000 cover photo produced
  three materially different Terra outcomes (no candidate, Cherubs / _Heroin
  Man_, and Cows / _Sexy Pee Story_) in 8.1-25.2 seconds. Production now uses
  the maintainer-accepted Sol + `high` + prompt-v2 path, but still uses
  uncropped images with no catalog retrieval. Multi-view sends more images per
  request, which raises per-scan token/latency cost proportionally; not yet
  measured against the deferred eval baseline.
- A fresh Linux/WSL machine needs `sudo npx playwright install-deps` once,
  in addition to `npx playwright install chromium`, or Chromium fails to
  launch with a missing-shared-library error (`libnspr4.so` and similar). Not
  previously documented; now noted in `docs/TESTING.md`.
- Authentication is the single development user. All rows are user-scoped, so
  swapping in real identity issuance later does not change the data model.
- Library `PATCH`/`DELETE` endpoints are documented as planned, not
  implemented (`docs/API.md`).
- Local-only infrastructure; backups and observability are Milestone 4.

## Session log

Newest first. One entry per agent session: date, agent, what changed, what was
decided.

- **2026-08-30 - Claude.** Resumed the Milestone 2 multi-view slice that Codex
  had left uncommitted (no handoff entry for it). Reviewed the full diff
  (contracts, schema/migration 007, repositories, AI adapter/prompt v3,
  worker, `/scan` UI, tests) end to end before continuing; found it complete
  and coherent, so finished it rather than restarting. Fixed Prettier
  formatting on 4 files flagged by `npm run check`. Verified in WSL/Node
  22.23.2 against the running Docker services: 39/39 unit tests, lint,
  typecheck, and build all pass; applied migration 007 and ran
  `npm run test:integration` (13/13, including a new multi-view worker test).
  Installed Playwright Chromium and its OS dependencies
  (`playwright install-deps`, with the maintainer running the sudo step), then
  added and passed a new e2e scenario grouping front/back/spine photos into
  one labeled scan (4/4 e2e tests). Updated `docs/API.md` with the `viewType`
  field, `docs/TESTING.md` with the new e2e coverage and the WSL
  `install-deps` requirement, and `docs/ROADMAP.md` to check off the
  completed slice and point the next resume at Milestone 2's batch slice. No
  ADR added: this extends the existing AI-identification request/response
  contract (ADR-0002) rather than changing a service boundary or provider.
  Nothing committed or pushed; the maintainer should review before commit.
- **2026-08-29 - Codex.** Closed Milestone 1 at the maintainer's direction after
  the Sol + `high` + prompt-v2 flow proved good enough for the early build. The
  formal private AI baseline is explicitly deferred until public rollout or
  model/cost optimization, and the resume point now begins Milestone 2 with
  multi-view scans.
- **2026-08-29 - Codex.** Simplified production album identification around the
  maintainer's actual goal. Changed the default and ignored local configuration
  from Terra to Sol while retaining `high` detail, introduced artist/title-first
  prompt v2, prevented missing pressing/edition evidence from being requested as
  an album-level review reason, added focused tests, and reframed the formal eval
  harness as optional until public rollout or optimization. `npm run check`
  (35/35 tests) and `npm run build` pass in WSL/Node 22. No live OpenAI calls
  were made.
- **2026-08-29 - Codex.** Implemented the requested Sol/Terra × high/auto
  experiment. Added multi-detail CLI execution, model/detail-keyed attempts and
  aggregates, schema-v2 checkpoints, a dedicated `eval:ai:vision-matrix`
  command, matrix unit coverage, and five documented test iterations. The real
  manifest dry-run reaches the readiness gate but has no development cases yet.
  `npm run check` (32/32 tests) and `npm run build` pass in WSL; no billable API
  calls were made.
- **2026-08-29 - Codex.** Diagnosed reported image-analysis quality and latency
  without changing runtime behavior. The database audit confirmed three
  byte-identical uploads produced unstable Terra results and 8.1-25.2 second
  durations. Identified likely contributors: single-image UI, `detail: high`
  downsampling, conservative edition-aware prompt/review routing, no image
  preprocessing, no catalog retrieval, and no completed eval baseline.
- **2026-08-29 - Codex.** Repaired the local WSL worker connection without
  deleting data: rotated the development PostgreSQL role, synchronized the
  ignored `.env`, and changed only `DATABASE_URL` to use
  `host.docker.internal` because WSL's `localhost:5432` reaches a separate
  PostgreSQL server. Docker PostgreSQL authentication and the normal WSL
  migration command were verified; the schema is current.
- **2026-08-29 - Codex.** Implemented `packages/evals`, a private live-model
  comparison CLI defaulting to GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna. Added strict manifest,
  consent, and maintainer-verification gates; request-by-request checkpoints;
  rank-1/top-3, edition, routing, schema/error, latency, token, and estimated-cost
  metrics; three test files; and `docs/EVALUATION.md`. Formatting, ESLint,
  typecheck, the eval package build, and 31/31 unit tests pass via direct Node
  entry points. No billable API calls were made; Node 22+ and completed private
  labels are still required for the baseline.
- **2026-08-29 - Codex.** Created a private 52-case single-image evaluation
  manifest and labeling prompt beside the maintainer's album photos. The
  manifest separates ChatGPT/Gemini suggestions from maintainer-verified ground
  truth and remains outside Git. No application code changed.

- **2026-08-29 — Codex.** Read-only project-state evaluation. Verified a
  clean working tree, `npm run check` (22/22 tests), and `npm run build`.
  Docker Desktop is stopped, so integration and e2e tests were not rerun.
  Corrected the stale claim that no browser e2e suite exists and recorded that
  `main` is two commits ahead of `origin/main`.
- **2026-08-26 — Claude (fifth session).** Confirmed the full pipeline works
  with real analysis. Built the phone-sized Playwright e2e suite (3 tests,
  passing): isolated production server, e2e database/queue, synthetic worker.
  Updated `docs/TESTING.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md`; only the AI eval baseline
  remains in Milestone 1. `npm run check` and `npm run build` pass.
- **2026-08-26 — Claude (fourth session).** Investigated a post-fix 422 on
  the same `.webp` file. Proved via database checksums and a live end-to-end
  reproduction (`tmp/diagnose-upload.mjs`) that the server pipeline is
  correct for all WebP variants and the retry ran the stale pre-fix browser
  bundle. Removed the diagnostic scans and objects. No code changed.
- **2026-08-26 — Claude (third session).** Committed the vertical slice
  (`8c692ed`). Fixed the upload rejection: added magic-byte sniffing to
  `packages/contracts` with tests, switched the scan page to declare the
  sniffed MIME type, and noted the client behavior in `docs/API.md`.
  `npm run check` (22 tests) and `npm run build` pass. Nothing pushed.
- **2026-08-26 — Claude (second session).** Recorded the in-flight WebP
  upload-rejection investigation as the resume point, with an independent
  read-only evaluation of the likely cause (extension-derived `File.type`
  versus server magic-byte sniff). No application code changed.
- **2026-08-26 — Claude.** Evaluated project state; verified `npm run check`
  and `npm run build` pass. Created `CLAUDE.md` and this handoff file; linked
  both from `AGENTS.md`. No application code changed.
